## Current Status
In Progress

## Project Overview
This is the On-Board Data Handling module of the inspireFly Cubesat.

The main goal of On Board Data Handling, a.k.a. OBDH, is to manage the cubesat's health information while in space, and determine the next state of operation it should enter.

## Educational Value Added
This project will provide students the oppurtunity to learn schematic design, PCB board design, how to perform basic and advanced soldering, and a deeper insight into space electronics design.

## Tasks
1. Update the schematic with instock parts <br>
2. Review the shcematic with advisors <br>
3. Update the PCB board with the new schematic <br>
4. Review the PCB board with advisors <br>
5. Begin constructing the PCB board <br>
6. Test the board <br>
